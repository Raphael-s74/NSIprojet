				Here are some of my favorite games because if I put them all in my opinion the board would be way too big (at least 10 km XD) but here is a little more for your information:
				Two Point Hospital, Human Fall Flat, Oxygen Not Included, BattleBlock Theater, BeamNG.drive
				</br>
				You can find all these games (except Minecraft) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/?l=french"> Steam</a>. 
				And little tips: if you want to have your games cheaper go to <a href="https://www.instant-gaming.com/fr/"> Instant Gaming</a> !
