						What is a vidéo game ?
					</h2>
				</li>
				<p>
					Acording to <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_vidéo"> Wikipédia</a> a video game 
					is an electronic game with a user interface allowing playful human interaction by generating visual feedback on a video device. 
					The video game player has peripherals to act on the game and perceive the consequences of its actions on a virtual environment. 
					The word 'video' in video games traditionally makes reference to a raster display device, but, following the popularization of the term, 
					it now involves any type of display device

					<a href="https://plarium.com/fr/blog/le-premier-jeu-video/"> Palarium</a> one of the first video games to be created would be "Bertie the Brain" in 1950
					made by inventor Josef Kates. It was used to play a childhood game, known as Morpion, and was exhibited at the Canadian National Exhibition.
